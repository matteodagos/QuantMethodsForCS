# Quantitative Methods for Computer Science - Course Project Repository

This repository contains the projects developed by myself and my colleague for an university course that focuses on two main topics: Logic and Probabilistic Methods for Computer Science. 

## Course Structure

The course is divided into two main parts:

1. **Logic for Computer Science**: This part covers the study of propositional and first-order logic, systems of formal proofs for both, application of logic to databases and Datalog.

2. **Probabilistic Methods for Complexity Estimation of Nondeterministic Algorithms**: This part delves into the study of the expected value of runtime and variance of the same by the bound of deviation, and uses Markov chain for algorithms on graph.

## Projects

The projects in this repository showcase the theoretical knowledge and practical applications learned throughout the course.

### Project 1: Formalization of Turing Machine in First-Order Logic (FOL) with equality

The first project is a detailed presentation on the formalization of the Turing Machine using first-order logic. The project showcases a demonstration of the undecidability of logical implication in First-Order Logic by reduction from the Halting Problem. 

The project can be found in the folder: `./Logica`

### Project 2: Probabilistic Methods for CS

The second project involves the solution of an assigned homework focusing on the application of probabilistic methods for the complexity estimation of nondeterministic algorithms. This is provided as a LaTeX document and includes detailed solutions for exercises based on course topics.

The project can be found in the folder: `./MetodiProbabilistici`

## Contributions

This repository is developed by me and Mirko Magistrado Dacara as part of the MQI course at Sapienza University of Rome. For any questions or discussions related to these projects, please create an issue or pull request.
